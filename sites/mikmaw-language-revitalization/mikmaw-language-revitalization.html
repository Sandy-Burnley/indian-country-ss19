         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>Language is seen as crucial to one's culture and identity, through past colonization efforts of Indigenous Nations, many Indigenous languages have been lost and forgotten. The efforts to revitalize these languages has exponentially grown globally, incorporating Nation, academia, and Federal support and funding. This case study looks at the Mi'kmaw language and current efforts through Universities and the Mi'kmaw First Nation to revitalize the Mi'kmaw Language verbally and digitally for future generations. </p>

      <h3>Mi'kmaw Nation</h3>
        <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
        <p> The Mi'kmaws' are a tribal nation located in the North Eastern part of North America in which have been around for approximately 10,00 years, according to the newest archeological discovery. The nation is a member of the Wabanaki Confederacy (bigorrin.com). Their tribal territory spans over North Eastern Canada including Nova Soctia, Prince Edward Island, parts of Quebec,the north shore of New Brunskwick, the Saint John River watershed, and parts of Newfoundland. In addition to Canada, the territory also encompasses eastern parts of Maine in the United States (Cape Breton Univeristy) As their territory spans a vast amount of area the Mi'kmaws' have separated their territory into seven districts known to them as: Kespukwitk, Sikepne'katik, Eski'kewaq, Unama'kik, Piktuk aqq Epekwitk, Sikniktewaq, and Kespe'kewaq. Each district contains a district chief, who acts as both the local chief and a delegate for the Grand Council Sante Mawiomi (Cape Brenton University). </p>

        <p> The Mi'kmaw created a close and civil relationship with European settlers, and starting in 1610, spanning over seventy years, began converting to Roman Catholicism. This conversion to European culture allowed to the Mi'kamw nation to create alliances and treaties with the British Crown (Cape Brenton University).</p>

      <h3>Mi'kmaw Language</h3>
        <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
        <p> The Mi'kmaw language has been battling extinction for 400 or more years, due to their connections and alliances with French and English speakers. The Mi'kmaw language has a drastic lingistical structure than English, making it easier to keep alliances by transitioning to English. In 1970, only 6,000 Natives were still speaking the language(Inglis 2004). </p>
        <p> Additionally, many Natives were not allowed to speak their language through government coloanization efforts in both the U.S. and Canada. The US 1819 Civilization Fund Act used missionaries to enhance their goal of exterminating Native languages and culture. The Indian Act of 1876, in Canada, worked in towards the linguiicide of Native languages as well. Throughout the late 1800's and early 1900's schools were either English or French speaking, another tool used to diminish the languages (Mclvor and McCarty 2016). However, education movements in the late 1900's pushed for a change to incorporate the Native language and practices once again. The 1972 Indian Education Act, in the U.S., provided funding for language and culture programs. Additionall the 1975 Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act allowed for Native to control over Native-serving schools (Mclvor and McCarty 2016). Both Canada and the US have begun efforts to increase the use of Native cultural practices and language after trying to extinguish them for many years. These efforts are growing today, especially within schooling. </p>
