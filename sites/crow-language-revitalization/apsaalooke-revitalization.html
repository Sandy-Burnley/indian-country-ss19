		 <p>After centuries of cultural oppression and erasure by the establishment of boarding schools and forced assimilation, Apsáalooke has been officially classified as an endangered language. Many generations of Crow people have lacked proficiency in the language of their ancestors due to years of racist legislation passed by a settler-colonial government uninterested in the preservation of Indigenous cultures and languages. However, the Crow Nation is diligently fighting to save their language and, their culture, and their connection with their ancestors. From the revival of the sacred Sweat Lodge ceremony as a means of cultural transmission, the establishment of the on-reservation Little Big Horn Community College, and the development of an Apsáalooke dictionary, this Indigenous group is currently doing everything they can to reclaim the culture that had almost been completely stripped away from them. For the purpose of this case study, the most important things to address is the history of the oppression of the Crow, modern-day cultural revitalization efforts, and efforts to preserve Indigenous languages.</p>

          <p>Ever since European arrival in the Americas, native peoples have had their ancestral homelands and traditional cultures stripped away from them to be replaced with the “standard” Euro-American settler culture. With the founding and subsequent expansion of the United States, more and more Indigenous communities were driven from their homes and forced to assimilate into American society. The Apsáalooke (Crow) Nation was particularly victimized, not just by the United States government, but other Indigenous communities as well. The Crow had an incredibly tense relationship with the nearby Lakota and Cheyenne. It is highly likely that this uneasiness was caused by American expansion. As groups like the Sioux and Cheyenne were driven from their ancestral lands, they were forced to move into the territory of the Crow. These tribes were constantly fighting each other for control of hunting grounds and other resources. Eventually, the Crow were forced to move up the Yellowstone River. The United States government got involved in this conflict and, through the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868), declared that the Lakota Sioux had control over lots of ancestral Crow lands -- from the Black Hills to the Big Horn Mountains <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Treaty with the Sioux -- Brulé, Oglala, Miniconjou, Yanktonai, Hunkpapa, Blackfeet, Cuthead, Two Kettle, Sans Arcs, and Santee -- and Arapaho, 1868.” Opened for signature April 29, 1868. Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties, vol. 2.">(<i>Treaty of Fort Laramie 1868</i>, Article V)</a>.  With growing pressure from the Lakota, the Cheyenne, and the Americans, the Apsáalooke peoples had nowhere to go. On May 7, 1868, they sold about 30 million acres of their land and moved to an 8-million-acre reservation in southern Montana. This was not the end of the injustice that the Crow people experienced, however.
          </p>
          <p>Prior to and in the earlier years of the nineteenth century, churches would often set up schools on reservations to teach Indigenous children to speak English and convert them to Christianity   <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Nixon, Lance. 2015. “A Dakota Family Remembers: Three Generations of Boarding School.” Capital Journal. December 3, 2015.">(Nixon, 2015)</a>.  In the mid-1800s, the United States government became more aggressive about assimilating Native Americans into the mainstream American culture and insisted that Indian children be sent to boarding schools several states away from where their homes were. By separating the children from their communities, they would “weaken family ties and destroy cultural traditions”   <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Nixon, Lance. 2015. “A Dakota Family Remembers: Three Generations of Boarding School.” Capital Journal. December 3, 2015.">(Nixon, 2015)</a>.  This was the first step to destroying Indigenous cultures and assimilation people into American society.</p>
          <p>Richard Henry Pratt opened the very first government-run Native American boarding school in the United States in 1879. It was called Carlisle Indian Industrial School and had an initial class of 136 students. Four years later in 1883, Indigenous families were threatened with starvation and poverty if they did not send their children to the boarding schools. There were six Crow children that were taken to Carlisle in 1883. They were:

      <h3>Cultural Revitalization Efforts</h3>
      <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
      <p>In recent decades, many Indigenous groups have been doing everything they can to reclaim their cultural heritages. One of the first important milestones was the formation of the American Indian Movement in 1968. Although it was mainly established to make social and political change in the wake of the African-American Civil Rights Movement and the protests against the Vietnam War, AIM really encouraged Indigenous peoples to stand up and reclaim/revitalize their traditional cultures. It is safe to say that, by the beginning of the twenty-first century, Native Americans were well on their way to reclaiming their cultures and reasserting their sovereignty. On September 13, 2007, the United Nations adopted the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. This document declared that:
<blockquote>Indigenous peoples have the right to revitalize, use, develop and transmit to future generations their histories, languages, oral traditions, philosophies, writing systems and literatures, and to designate and retain their own names for communities, places, and persons <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 2007. United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. United Nations.">(<i>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</i>, 2007)</a>.
</blockquote>
This policy was, for the most part, met with overwhelming support. However, it did encounter opposition from the four biggest settler-colonial countries -- the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. These four nations eventually changed their votes, but it is interesting to see how the people benefitting the most from settler-colonialism are the same people who voted against letting Indigenous peoples have cultural independence.</p>
<p>The Crow Nation has been doing a lot to revitalize their culture. Lanny Real Bird talks about how the Apsáalooke have been trying to teach the younger generations to understand the importance of “horsemanship, family, ceremonial preparation, individual roles or responsibilities, discipline, cultural gatherings, and the respect for our elders and ourselves. This also includes formal teachings in informal settings regarding the universe, philosophy, traditional values, ethics, religion, and even disciplines in being competitive and resilient” <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Real Bird, Lanny. 2017. “Reflections on Revitalizing and Reinforcing Native Languages and Cultures.” Edited by William Ruff. Cogent Education 4 (1).">(Real Bird, 2017)</a>.  For the Crow, one of the main ways of transmitting cultural and ancestral information between elders and youngsters is through the Sweat Lodge ceremony. This is an incredibly important medium to communicate “prayer, healing, teaching, preparation, personal visions, storytelling, humor, role of clan reinforcement, and community missions” <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Real Bird, Lanny. 2017. “Reflections on Revitalizing and Reinforcing Native Languages and Cultures.” Edited by William Ruff. Cogent Education 4 (1).">(Real Bird, 2017)</a>. Through the establishment of boarding schools and the removal of Indigenous children from their families, the Sweat Lodge ceremony and the passing of information between generations was threatened. This ritual has made an incredible comeback and is still practiced in Apsáalooke society as a way of transmitting cultural information between older and younger generations.

     <h3>Preservation of a Language</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
    <p>In 1990, George H. W. Bush signed the Native American Languages Act (also known as NALA). According to Section 104 of NALA, it is the policy of the United States to:
<blockquote>(1) preserve, protect, and promote the rights and freedom of Native Americans to use, practice, and develop Native American languages; (2) allow exceptions to teacher certification requirements for Federal programs, and programs funded in whole or in part by the Federal Government, for instruction in Native American when such teacher certification requirements hinder the employment of qualified teachers who teach in Native American languages, and to encourage State and territorial governments to make similar exceptions; (3) encourage and support the use of Native American languages as a medium of instruction in order to encourage and support -- (A) Native American language survival, (B) educational opportunity, (C) increased student success and performance, (D) increased student awareness and knowledge of their culture and history, and (E) increased student and community pride; (4) encourage State and local education programs to work with Native American parents, educator, Indian tribes, and other Native American governing bodies to use the Native American languages as a medium of instruction in all schools funded by the Secretary of the Interior; (6) fully recognize the inherent right of Indian tribes and other Native American governing bodies, States, territories, and possessions of the United States to take action on, and give official status to, their Native American languages for the purpose of conducting their own business; (7) support the granting of comparable proficiency achieved through course work in a Native American language the same academic credit as comparable proficiency achieved through course work in a foreign language, with recognition of such Native American language proficiency by institutions of higher education as fulfilling foreign language entrance or degree requirements; and (8) encourage all institutions of elementary, secondary and higher education, where appropriate, to include Native American languages in the curriculum in the same manner as foreign languages and to grant proficiency in Native American languages the same full academic credit as proficiency in foreign languages <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Exec. Order No. PUBLIC LAW 101-477, 3 C.F.R. (1990).">(Executive Order No. Public Law 101-477, 1990)</a>.
</blockquote>
This was the first step in a long battle towards federal recognition of Indigenous languages and gave Native American communities the opportunity to reclaim the languages that had been stripped away from them. Since 1990, there has been a ton of legislation passed and social programs established to help Indigenous groups revitalize their languages.

    <p>Apsáalooke, the language of the Crow, has been officially classified as an endangered language. However, steps are being taken by members of the community to ensure that it does not go extinct. The Little Big Horn Community College, which is located on the Crow reservation in Montana, offers extensive courses in Apsáalooke. There has also been an increased usage of the language in on-reservation elementary and high schools. The Crow Nation is also in league with an organization called “Our Mother Tongues” that helps them organize and fund their language conservation efforts. About 85% of the 11,000 Crow peoples speak Apsáalooke as their primary language, but the elders are concerned about maintaining this fluency. Because knowing the English language is necessary for success off-reservation, it can be hard for people to retain their bilingualism. There is also concern over whether or not Apsáalooke has changed linguistically since the establishment of boarding schools and the era of forced assimilation <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Leffner, Nikolai M. n.d. “Apsáalooke: The Story of the Crow Language.” Apsáalooke: The Story of the Crow Language | Environmental Studies | Lake Forest College. Lake Forest College. Accessed April 11, 2019.">(Leffner, 2019)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Over the last few years, the Crow Language Consortium has been working extremely hard to preserve their language. One of their biggest accomplishments has been updating school curricula that have not been updated since the 1960s and 1970s and proving adequate and accessible materials to those studying Apsáalooke <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Sukut, Juliana. 2019. “Crow Language Bowl Held at MSUB Powwow Discusses Language Revitalization.” The Billings Gazette. April 7, 2019.">(Sukut, 2019)</a>.  They, along with The Language Conservancy, made a 15,000-word Crow dictionary. It is still a work in progress, but they are hoping to get up to 20,000 words within the next year. They have been assisted by multiple people who are fluent in Apsáalooke, including numerous tribal elders. Wil Meya, a board member of the Crow Language Consortium and CEO of The Language Conservancy, said he believes that “the Crow language has perhaps the best chance of survival in North America” because of the number of fluent speakers that have helped to develop the Apsáalooke dictionary <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Sukut, Juliana. 2019. “Crow Language Bowl Held at MSUB Powwow Discusses Language Revitalization.” The Billings Gazette.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>The era of boarding schools and forced assimilation was devastating to Indigenous communities all over the United States. Children were taken from their families and sent to institutions several states away from their homes. They were then forced to abandon their native religions and languages in favor of practicing Christianity and speaking English. In later decades, legislation was passed the allowed for the encouragement and protection of Indigenous groups and their efforts to revitalize their cultures. For the Apsáalooke people of the Crow Nation, it would be a long road. That does not mean, however, that important milestones have not been reached. From the revival of the Sweat Lodge ceremony as a medium of communicating cultural information between generations, the founding of the Little Big Horn Community College on the Crow reservation in Montana and full courses it offers in the Crow language, and the 20,000 word Apsáalooke dictionary that is currently in the works, this group has made tremendous headway in their efforts to reclaim their culture. Unfortunately, the Crow and the crucial steps they have taken toward self-determination and sovereignty are not recognized by the mainstream American public and is often overshadowed by the accomplishments of larger Indigenous groups such as the Lakota or the Navajo. Considering all the progress that the Apsáalooke people have made towards reclaiming their culture, it is incredibly important to recognize them and all that they have done.
